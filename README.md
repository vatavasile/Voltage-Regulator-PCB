# USB-C Voltage Regulator PCB

## Overview
This project is a custom PCB designed as part of a university exercise. The goal was to design and route a functional USB-C (USB 2.0) interface using KiCad while respecting PCB design rules and manufacturing constraints.

---

## Objectives
- Design a USB-C connector interface  
- Implement correct CC configuration for device mode  
- Route USB data lines (D+ / D−)  
- Handle power distribution (VBUS & GND)  
- Ensure manufacturability using Design Rule Checks (DRC)  

---

## Tools Used
- KiCad (schematic capture and PCB layout)  
- GitHub (version control and documentation)  

---

## Features
- USB-C receptacle with correct pin mapping  
- 5.1kΩ pull-down resistors on CC1 and CC2  
- Proper VBUS routing  
- Ground plane implementation  
- DRC-compliant layout
